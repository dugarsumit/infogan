# Reimplementation of InfoGAN in Tensorflow
The code in this repository was implemented on top the official [repository](https://github.com/openai/InfoGAN) of the paper -  [InfoGAN: Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03657)

The experiments from this work are summarized in the following poster.
